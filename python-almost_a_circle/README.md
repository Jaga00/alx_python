This is the almost a circle project. It's a programming exercise or problem that is often used to assess a programmer's understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python. The exercise typically involves creating a class that represents a shape that's almost a circle. The goal is to implement methods and attributes that mimic the behavior of a circle while introducing some variations or constraints.
