Learning about Python - Network.

When it comes to networking in Python, there are several libraries and modules available that make it easier to work with network-related tasks. Some of the key libraries for networking in Python include:

Socket: The built-in socket module provides a low-level interface to network sockets, allowing you to create and manage sockets for various types of network communication, such as TCP and UDP.

Requests: The requests library is commonly used for making HTTP requests. It simplifies tasks like sending HTTP GET and POST requests, handling response data, and managing cookies.

Twisted: Twisted is an event-driven networking engine written in Python. It provides a high-level framework for building networking applications, including support for protocols like TCP, UDP, and more.

Scapy: Scapy is a packet manipulation library that allows you to craft, send, and receive network packets at various layers. It's often used for network analysis, penetration testing, and creating custom network tools.

Paramiko: Paramiko is a library for SSH (Secure Shell) protocol implementation. It allows you to establish SSH connections, execute remote commands, and transfer files securely.

PySocks: PySocks provides support for using SOCKS proxy servers. It's useful for creating applications that need to communicate through proxy servers for anonymity or firewall traversal.

SocketServer and ThreadingServer: These modules in the socketserver library provide a framework for building network servers with different concurrency models, including threaded and forking servers.

Asyncio: The asyncio library is used for writing asynchronous code, which is particularly useful for building high-performance network applications that can handle many simultaneous connections.

SocketCAN: If you're working with Controller Area Network (CAN) bus systems, the socketcan module allows Python programs to communicate over CAN bus networks.

These libraries and modules cover a wide range of networking tasks, from basic socket communication to more advanced networking concepts like HTTP requests, SSH connections, and asynchronous networking.
